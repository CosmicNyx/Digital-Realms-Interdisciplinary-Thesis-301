## ScenarioManagement

The `ScenarioManagement` folder contains a collection of JSON files and JavaScript scripts that are essential for handling various narrative scenarios in an interactive application. This setup enables dynamic content delivery tailored to user interactions.

### Overview of Contents

- **`intro.json`:** Contains the initial dialogue or prompts presented to the user, setting the stage for further interaction.
  - Example Text: "Oh, hello! Do you know where we are?"

- **`yesScenario.json`:** Manages the content displayed when the user responds affirmatively to a prompt.
  - Example Text: "You chose 'Yes'. This is the 'Yes' scenario."

- **`noScenario.json`:** Manages the content for a negative response from the user, directing the flow of interaction accordingly.
  - Example Text: "You chose 'No'. This is the 'No' scenario."

- **`script.js`:** Contains the logic for loading and displaying the scenario texts based on user interactions, implementing interactive features like conditional navigation and dynamic text effects.

- **`textData.js`:** Contains additional predefined text data used across various parts of the application to support the dynamic text display functionality.

### Purpose and Usage

The primary purpose of this folder is to organize and streamline the management of different interactive scenarios within the application. It offers a clear and straightforward method to update narrative content without altering the core application logic, making it ideal for projects that require flexibility in content presentation and narrative branching.

### Current Status and Future Plans

As a work-in-progress, the `ScenarioManagement` folder is expected to undergo several updates, including:

- Enhancements to the scenario handling logic to support more complex user decisions and interactions.
- Expansion of the scenario files to encompass a wider range of responses and outcomes.
- Integration of additional multimedia elements to enrich the user experience.
- Optimization and refactoring of the JavaScript logic to improve performance and maintainability.

### Integration Tips

To integrate the `ScenarioManagement` toolkit into your project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure each JSON file is correctly linked within your project's main JavaScript files.
2. Utilize the scenario data to conditionally render text and manage flow based on user inputs.
3. Regularly test different scenarios to ensure that transitions and text displays are functioning as expected.

This toolkit is particularly suited for interactive storytelling applications, educational tools, or any web-based platform where user choices significantly influence subsequent content and outcomes.
