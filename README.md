### Folder Descriptions

#### `drawingImages/`

This script is responsible for dynamically displaying images on the web page at random locations upon user interaction. Hereâ€™s how it functions:

- **Initialization on DOM Load:** The script only executes once the entire HTML document is fully loaded, ensuring all elements are available for manipulation.
- **Image Array:** A predefined array contains the filenames of the images to be displayed. This array can be customized to include any number of images.
- **Random Image Display:** When a user clicks anywhere on the page, the script randomly selects an image from the array and displays it at a random position within the viewport.
- **Image Placement:** Each new image is placed at a calculated random position that considers the viewport dimensions to ensure it remains visible.
- **Modular Functions:**
  - `getRandomImage()`: Selects a random image from the specified array.
  - `createNewImageElement()`: Creates a new `<img>` element, sets its source, and appends it to a specified container.
  - `setLocation()`: Positions an element absolutely within the browser window at coordinates `(x, y)`.

#### Usage

To integrate this script:
1. Ensure that you have a div element with the id `container` in your HTML where the images will be appended.
2. Modify the `imagesArray` with the paths to the images you want to use.
3. Include this script in your HTML to enable dynamic image placement on user clicks.

This tool is particularly useful for interactive art installations, dynamic galleries, or any project requiring a playful, engaging visual element.
